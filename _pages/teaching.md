I have been fortunate to be on course staff for three separate courses, all offered by the EECS department at UC Berkeley. These were:
- EE 127 (Optimization Models In Engineering).
    - The course is a first course in optimization theory and practice, teaching the fundamentals of convexity, unconstrained optimization, constrained optimization, duality, linear and quadratic programming, and various applications. 
    - I was a Discussion TA in [Fall 2020](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-fall-eecs-127-001-lec-001) and the Head Content TA in [Fall 2022](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-fall-eecs-127-001-lec-001) and [Spring 2023](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-spring-eecs-127-001-lec-001).

- EE 16B (Designing Information Systems and Devices II).
    - The course is a second course in linear algebra for engineers and a survey course for many sub-fields of electrical engineering, such as circuits, device physics, control theory, signal processing, and data analysis. 
    - I was a Content TA in [Spring 2021](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~ee16b/sp21/) and [Fall 2021](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~ee16b/fa21/) and a Head Content TA in [Spring 2022](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu//~ee16b/sp22/).

- CS 170 (Efficient Algorithms and Intractable Problems).
    - The course is a first course in algorithm theory, teaching fundamental algorithmic ideas such as divide-and-conquer, graphs, trees, and dynamic programming, as well as more advanced ideas such as network flows and approximations to NP-hard problems. 
    - I was a Reader in [Spring 2020](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2020-fall-cs-170-001-lec-001).

In the course of the above appointments, I earned the following awards:
- In 2022, I was given the UC Berkeley Outstanding Graduate Student Instructor Award (~60 recipients/year).
- In 2023, I was given the UC Berkeley EECS Department Outstanding TA Award (~5 recipients/year).

As a Reader, my responsibilities included:
- Grading homework and exams.

As a Discussion TA, my responsibilities included all of the above, plus:
- Teaching either one or two discussion sections each week.
- Teaching review sessions at least twice a semester in preparation for exams.
- Running two or more open office hours a week.

As a Content TA, my responsibilities included all of the above, plus:
- Composing homeworks and discussion worksheets each week, as well as the solutions.
- Composing a midterm and final exam.

As a Head Content TA, my responsibilities included all of the above, plus:
- Leading large-scale initiatives, such as design of a course project, or thorough and detailed lecture notes. ([Example course notes for EE 127.](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee127/sp23/assets/notes/eecs127_reader.pdf))
- Managing a team of Graduate Student Content TAs.
- Handling administrative work (e.g., website administration) and logistics when and where required.
